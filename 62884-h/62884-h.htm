<h1>FLOWERING PLANTS OF SOUTH AFRICA</h1>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> cultivation of South African plants in Europe dates back to early
times.</p>

<p>Indeed, it may safely be assumed that it was in vogue soon after the
Dutch settlement at the Cape, for Holland during the 16th and 17th
centuries held first place in European horticulture. Her cities even
vied with one another in the establishment of gardens of exotic plants,
many of which came from the Cape.</p>

<p>These treasures created such interest and attracted such attention that
Cape plants soon became the fashion and object of envy throughout
Europe. Collectors were specially despatched to these shores for the
purpose of hunting out and securing their botanical wealth.</p>

<p>Evidence also is not lacking that the cultivation of indigenous plants
was carried out at the Cape prior to 1700.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, little remains to-day in South Africa to do credit to
the past preservation and cultivation of our native flora.</p>

<p>In recent years, however, considerable interest has again sprung up in
this direction; in fact, it is rapidly becoming fashionable to have a
rockery of aloes, vijgies, and other succulents as one of the chief
adjuncts to the garden.</p>

<p>Apart from these&mdash;perhaps better-known plants&mdash;there are many beautiful
flowering herbs, shrubs and trees of the veld, which might with
advantage be grown in our gardens and around our homes.</p>

<p>It is with the object of bringing these gems of nature to the notice of
the public that this publication is offered.</p>

<p>A work of this kind is of necessity a costly undertaking, and its future
existence and ultimate success will depend largely on the support which
it receives at the hands of the public.</p>

<p>The publication of the present volume has only been made possible
through the interest and keenness of a South African lady, whose love
for her country and its natural beauties has been the means of procuring
the necessary funds for the initiation of the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<p>It is proposed to issue this publication as an illustrated serial, much
on the same lines as the well-known Curtis’s <i>Botanical Magazine</i>, and
for imitating which no apology need be tendered.</p>

<p>Should the publication be the means of stimulating further interest in
the study and cultivation of our indigenous plants amongst the rising
generation, the desire and object of its promoters will be achieved.</p>

<p>Living plants suitable for illustration, plants of economic value, or
plants of general interest, will always be gladly received and welcomed
by the Editor.</p>

<p>As regards the illustrations the Editor has been most fortunate in being
able to place the work of that skilful artist, Miss K. A. Lansdell,
before the public, while the descriptions have been prepared by Dr. E.
Percy Phillips, Botanist in charge of the National Herbarium, to both of
whom it is a pleasure to express one’s special thanks for the trouble
and care which they have taken.</p>

<p>For the information of those of our readers who have not been fortunate
enough to visit our country or our inland capital, it may be added that
the illustration on our cover represents a glimpse of the magnificent
Union Buildings at Pretoria, under whose shadow this work is being
prepared, and on whose site the plants here figured are grown.</p>

<p>It has been the Editor’s privilege and good fortune to see a
comparatively bare kopje converted in the course of a few years into the
site of a grand and stately building surrounded with many of the
country’s most beautiful and interesting herbs and shrubs.</p>

<p>The illustration depicts such characteristic plants as the arborescent
<i>Aloe Marlothii</i>, Berg.; the handsome <i>Aloe Wickensii</i>, Pole Evans (in
the centre); <i>Aloe aculeata</i>, Pole Evans; the neat <i>Aloe Peglerae</i>,
Schönland; <i>Cotyledon orbiculata</i>, Linn.; <i>Encephalartos Altensteinii</i>,
Lehm; and some arborescent euphorbias.</p>

<p>Although most of the plants just mentioned are typical of the vegetation
of the Transvaal, an endeavour will be made in our magazine to depict in
each volume as far as possible an equal number of floral representatives
from all the Provinces.</p>

<p>As the authority for colour nomenclature, <i>Colour Standards and Colour
Nomenclature</i>, by R. Ridgway, Washington, 1912, has been adopted.</p>

<p>This well-known garden plant, commonly called the “Agapanthus” or “Blue
Lily,” was introduced into cultivation in England from the Cape as far
back as 1692, and was figured by Commelin of Amsterdam in 1697.</p>

<p>In South Africa the plant is characteristic of the vegetation found on
high mountain ranges. It usually occurs on well-drained slopes.</p>

<p>It is a herbaceous plant with a tuberous rootstock from which 6-10 broad
strap-shaped leaves arise. The lower stalk is about a metre high, and
bears an umbel of 20-50 handsome blue flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;<i>Rootstock</i> short, tuberous, with fleshy cylindric roots.
<i>Leaves</i> dark green, 6-10, basal, 20-60 cm. long, 2-4 cm. broad,
strap-shaped, obtuse, glabrous. <i>Peduncle</i> O·25-1 metre high, terete,
glabrous. <i>Inflorescence</i> a many-flowered umbel. <i>Spathe-valves</i> 2·5 cm.

<p>This remarkable Aloe was collected by Messrs. Wickens and Pienaar in
M‘Phathlele’s Location in the Pietersburg District during January, 1914.
Specimens brought to the Botanical Laboratories, Pretoria, flowered
during July and August of the same year.</p>

<p>In M‘Phathlele’s Location the plant occurs in vast numbers in a very
gregarious manner on the open sandy plains. In fact, it is not uncommon
to find long, continuous belts of thickly crowded plants extending for
two or three hundred yards in length. The plant is typical of the Low
Veld and the river valleys which run from the Zoutpansberg into the
Limpopo basin.</p>

<p>At first the racemes are furnished with widely separated spherical to
globular flower-buds which develop with considerable slowness.</p>

<p>The unopened flowers are rich nopal red (R.C.S.), tinged with green at
the tips. When open, the flowers become a sulphur-yellow (R.C.S.).</p>

<p>Our illustration was made from a plant in the Aloe collection at the
Botanical Laboratories, Pretoria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A succulent, stemless plant. <i>Leaves</i> 16-23 in a dense
rosette, glaucous, erect-spreading, 45-50 cm. long, 8-9 cm. broad at the

young buds distinctly globular; in open flowers nopal-red (R.C.S.),
green at the tips; mature flowers sulphur-yellow (R.C.S.) and tinged
with red towards the base. <i>Floral-bracts</i> reflexed, 5-6 mm. long,
ovate-cuspidate, scariose, pellucid. <i>Pedicels</i> recurved, 3-4 mm. long.
<i>Perianth</i> 25 mm. long, cylindrical-ventricose; outer segments free for
15-17 mm., obtuse and recurved at the apex, 3-5-veined; inner segments

<p>This handsome species of <i>Arctotis</i> was raised in the Garden of the
Division of Botany, Pretoria, from seed received in 1916 from Mr. C.
Foster, of Clanwilliam, after whom I have much pleasure in naming it.
The large size of the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span> head and the delicate colouring of the
rays make it worthy of a place in all South African Gardens. At Pretoria
it flowers freely and has set mature seed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A herbaceous perennial 60-90 cm. high. <i>Leaves</i> many,

outline, obtuse, produced at the base into a long petiole, sparsely
pubescent on the upper surface, white-woolly on the lower surface;
leaf-lobes about 4 cm. long, 1-5·2 cm. broad, oblong, obtuse, with
toothed margins; the terminal lobe much larger, otherwise similar;
petiole up to 16 cm. long, flat on the upper surface, convex beneath,
sparsely glandular-pilose; upper leaves sessile, lanceolate, acute,
sparsely pilose, with more or less entire margins. <i>Peduncles</i> pale in
colour at the base, gradually becoming indian purple (R.C.S.) towards
the apex, 17-19 cm. long, terete, striate, pilose, the hairs becoming
reddish and denser towards the apex. <i>Capitulum</i> solitary, 7-9 cm. in

<hr />

<p>This plant, the “Barberton Daisy,” has attracted much attention in
recent years as an addition to the herbaceous garden.</p>

<p>It was first discovered in the Transvaal by the collector Rehmann about
1878, and later by the Hon. R. Jameson on the mountains round Barberton.
In 1889 it flowered at Kew Gardens and was illustrated in the
<i>Gardener’s Chronicle</i> for that year. Shortly afterwards a coloured
plate and description appeared in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> (t. 7087).
The specific name was proposed by the late Dr. Bolus, who himself
collected the species at Barberton.</p>

<p>A mass of these plants in full bloom is very striking, the scarlet rays
standing out in strong contrast to the green leaves.</p>

<p>The specimen from which the present illustration was made flowered at
the Botanical Laboratories, Pretoria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;<i>Rootstock</i> perennial. <i>Leaves</i> basal, numerous, 22-45 cm.

<p>This striking species of <i>Gladiolus</i> belongs to the section
<i>Dracocephali</i> of the genus which contains some seven species all
characterised by having the upper segments hooded. It is a favourite
with cultivators, and has also been taken up by nurserymen who grow
blooms for sale. Like a great many of our beautiful native species, it
was left to Kew Gardens to bring the species to public notice.</p>

<p>Corms of this <i>Gladiolus</i> were brought to England by Mr. Thomas Cooper,
who collected in South Africa for Mr. Wilson Saunders. It first flowered
at Kew in 1872, when it was described and figured.</p>

<p>The species is easy of cultivation, and flowers at Pretoria in November.
Apart from the interest it is to gardeners generally, it should be of
special interest to breeders, as there seems little doubt that some very
fine hybrids could be raised from this species.</p>

<hr />

<p>The remarkable group of South African plants&mdash;the <i>Proteaceae</i>&mdash;still
continues to yield interesting novelties, though it was monographed as
recently as 1910. This is especially true of the genus <i>Leucadendron</i>,
on which much work remains to be done.</p>

<p>The specimens from which our illustration was made were collected by Mr.
T. P. Stokoe in the Klein River Mountains at Sinkerhausgat, near
Standford, in the Caledon Division. Mr. Stokoe has made some interesting
discoveries in this region, amongst which was this new <i>Leucadendron</i>
which he forwarded to the Division of Botany in September, 1918. It is
quite distinct from any other species of <i>Leucadendron</i>, inasmuch as the
male inflorescence is surrounded by large bracts giving it the
appearance of a <i>Protea</i>.</p>

<p>The specimen figured was first mentioned in the <i>Gardener’s Chronicle</i>,
1892, as <i>Calla Pentlandii</i>, and two years later in the same publication
was again brought to notice as <i>Richardia Pentlandii</i>, under which name
it was described and figured in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>. Mr. N. E.

the same as <i>Richardia angustiloba</i> which was described as early as
1865. It was introduced into cultivation by Mr. R. Whyte, Pentland

<p>According to the <i>Flora Capensis</i> the only species in the genus
<i>Freesia</i> is <i>F. refracta</i>, Klatt, which is a native of the eastern
districts of Albany, Bathurst, etc., and is characterised by having
(among other characters) the slender lower part of the perianth-tube
shorter than the upper broader part and not more than twice as long as
the bracts. But there are at least three other species found in other
regions that distinctly differ in habit or in the tube of the flower or
in both. One of them collected by Burchell in Bechuanaland and at
present undescribed, has a very long tube. Another is a plant found in
the coast districts of Swellendam, Riversdale, Ladismith, etc., figured
and described by Thunberg under the name of <i>Gladiolus Sparrmanni</i>, upon
which I found the species <i>Freesia Sparrmannii</i>. The reference to this
figure is omitted by Schultes in his edition of Thunberg’s <i>Fl. Cap.</i>,
and is not quoted by Baker, but it accurately agrees with the plant
Zeyher collected along the Buffeljagts River in Swellendam Division and
distributed under No. 4027. It conspicuously differs from <i>F. refracta</i>
by the very much longer slender part to the perianth tube, and although
Thunberg’s plant and that collected by Zeyher have purplish-tinted
flowers, I place the plant here figured as a yellow variety of it,
because I find that the late P. MacOwan, in a letter preserved at Kew,
gives the following particulars concerning this species, which he also
considers distinct from <i>F. refracta</i>. He writes: “All along the coast
from Cape Point towards Agulhas, notably near Mossel Bay, the other
<i>Freesia</i> grows wild. I have never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> it in my Eastern Province
peregrinations.... Its colour varies very much, from pale golden
daffodil tint to pure white, and is either with or without purplish
stains on the outside of the perianth-segments. Here, at the Hort.
C.B.S., we paid much attention to this lovely bulb, grew it year after
year, roguing out all the yellow and purple-stained individuals and
sowing the whitest. This is the ‘<i>Freesia refracta alba</i>’ of gardens.”</p>

<p>This note gives the origin of <i>F. refracta</i> var. <i>alba</i>, Baker, <i>Handb.
Irid.</i> p. 167, which should now be called <i>F. Sparrmannii</i> var. <i>alba</i>,
for it certainly is not the same as the true <i>F. refracta</i>, and
Thunberg’s original name must be upheld.</p>

<p>The plant here figured is doubtless the pale golden form mentioned by
MacOwan, and it differs from the yellow-flowered <i>F. xanthospila</i> by the
very long slender part of its perianth-tube.&mdash;<span class="smcap">N. E. Brown.</span></p>

<p>This species, indigenous to Natal, represents only one of many of our
native plants, which have been brought to the notice of horticulturists
by English Nurserymen. A living plant was exhibited at a meeting of the
Horticultural Society in February 1854 by Messrs. Backhouse, who
imported the plant from Natal. The specimen from which our illustration
was made was collected by Miss K. A. Lansdell at Ifafa on the South
Coast of Natal. The species is a shade lover, and is usually found
flowering in the shelter of rocks and trees. The size and number of the
flowers have been much improved by cultivation, and several hybrids have
been raised from the species. The flowers may vary in colour from a red
to a yellowish-red.</p>

<p>This handsome plant is a shrub or sometimes becomes a small tree, and is
without doubt one of our finest native flowering shrubs. It is common in
Natal, where it flowers in early spring and summer. The large fragrant
bell-shaped flowers are produced in great profusion and give to the
plant a very striking appearance. The species has been known to European
cultivation for over sixty years, but is usually grown in the
greenhouse. It is frequently seen in gardens in Durban, Natal, and
specimens have been grown in Queens Park, East London, but the plant has
not received the attention from South African horticulturists which it
deserves.</p>

<p>Our illustration was made from specimens collected by Miss K. A.
Lansdell in the Stella bush near Durban, Natal. The native name is
“Isi-Qoba.”</p>

<p>This species was first collected by the traveller Rehmann and described
by Engler in 1883 as <i>Zantedeschia Rehmanni</i>. Among English
horticulturists the plant attracted a lot of attention, and was several
times referred to in the <i>Gardener’s Chronicle</i>. The chief attraction to
cultivators is the deep red colour of the spathes, but when grown in
English gardens and also in its native climate, the colour varies
considerably. Dr. Medley Wood notes that at the Natal Herbarium, Durban,
the original deep red colour returned to the plants after being
cultivated fifteen years. This loss of colour, however, does not appear
to be constant among plants which flowered for the first time at the
Division of Botany Gardens, Pretoria, from tubers which were sent by S.
G. Marwick, Esq., Assistant Commissioner, Hlatikulu, Swaziland. In these
the colour ranged from pale pink to deep red. After fertilization,
however, and during the formation of the fruits the colour gradually
fades from the spathes and they become green. The species was introduced
into England by Mr. R. W. Adlam of Natal, who sent tubers to the
Cambridge Botanic Gardens. The leaves vary from a uniform green to green
with white markings, or green with darker green markings.</p>

<p>This species was first collected by Mr. P. J. Pienaar at Smit’s Drift,
near Pietersburg, in January 1914, where it is very common on and around
the isolated granite kopjes, though it also occurs in the open flat
country. A number of plants were obtained for the gardens of the Union
Buildings at Pretoria, where they have been established, and specimens
are also growing in the Aloe collection at the Division of Botany
Gardens, Pretoria. The species flowers from May to July.</p>

<p>This handsome <i>Aloe</i> occurs on the northern slopes of the hills around
Pretoria, and is especially abundant on Meintjes’ Kop. It is also found
near Lydenburg, at Barberton, the Premier Mine, and along the foot of
the Lebombo range of mountains. The flowers usually appear in May, and
when in flower the plants attract large numbers of brightly coloured
sun-birds. The tall branched inflorescence forms the most striking
feature of the plant, and when one compares it with that of <i>Aloe
lineata</i>, which is unbranched and differs in many other important
respects, it seems almost incredible that <i>A. pretoriensis</i> should have
been mistaken by so many botanists for <i>A. lineata</i> as has been done.</p>

<p>The species of Pachypodium figured in our illustration was first
described by the famous traveller, Carl Thunberg, in the year 1794.
Thunberg gathered his plants, on which he based his description, between
the Gouritz and Sundays River. The name he gave to the species was
<i>Echites succulenta</i>. Robert Brown, in 1909, surmised that the plant
placed by Thunberg in the genus Echites would most likely constitute a
distinct genus, and in 1830 Lindley confirmed this, and founded the
genus <i>Pachypodium</i> upon, and gave an excellent figure of, this species
of <i>Pachypodium</i> in the <i>Botanical Register</i>, at t. 1321, but gave it a
new specific name, which is omitted from the <i>Flora Capensis</i>.</p>

<p>The Protea illustrated here is a very common species on the hillsides in
the neighbourhood of Pretoria. It sometimes attains a height of 15 feet,
is much branched, and has no distinct trunk. We have no record of the
species occurring further south, but it certainly extends into Rhodesia,
and perhaps&mdash;though we have some doubt on this point&mdash;into Abyssinia.
The species was first described by the botanist Willdenow, under the
present specific name in 1797, and he based his description on a figure
which appeared in Bruce’s <i>Travels to discover the Source of the Nile</i>,
which was published in 1790. The point as to whether the Transvaal plant
is the same species as that figured by Bruce needs further
investigation.</p>

<p>The specimens from which the figure was made were collected by Miss I.

<p>This remarkable and handsome leguminous plant was collected by the late
Dr. Bolus near the Komati River Drift in 1886, and described by him as
<i>Lonchocarpus speciosus</i>. Dr. Harms of Berlin, when examining a
collection of Rhodesian plants, came across the same species on which he
founded the genus <i>Bolusanthus</i>. The free stamens would indicate that it
is not a species of <i>Lonchocarpus</i>.</p>

<p>Our illustration was made from material collected by Dr. Pole Evans at
Chunies Poort, Transvaal, in October, 1919. The tree, which frequently
reaches a height of 30-40 feet, is locally known as “Van Wyk’s Hout,” or
“Wild Wisteria.” It is frequent along the northern foothills of the
Zoutpansberg range of mountains and in the low veld bush country along
the Selati River. When in full bloom it is one of the most beautiful
sights seen in the veld, and is a species which should certainly be
introduced into cultivation.</p>

<p>The above figure in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> was published in 1878, and
together with the description which accompanied it was the first
recognition that the so-called “Gift Boom” of the Eastern Province
consisted of two distinct species. The plant from which the figure in
the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> was made, flowered at Kew Gardens in 1878. Mr.
T. R. Sim states that he cannot distinguish <i>A. spectabilis</i>, Hook. from
<i>A. venenata</i>, G. Don., but regards it as an eastern coastal form. The
plant is reputed to be extremely poisonous, and as the fruits are so
attractive-looking, it makes the species also a dangerous one. In habit
our plant is an evergreen shrub which lends itself to cultivation in the
shrubbery; the flowers are very fragrant, and even in fruit the shrub
does not lose its beauty, as the dark purple fruits show up
conspicuously against the green leaves. The specimen figured here was
presented by Mr. J. W. Wickens from the Garden of the Union Buildings,
Pretoria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;Shrub 4-10 ft. high. <i>Branches</i> glabrous. <i>Leaves</i> shortly
petioled; petioles 6 mm. long; lamina 7-10 cm. long, 2·2-4 cm. broad,
elliptic or elliptic-lanceolate, shortly acuminate, acute, narrowed at
the base, glabrous, with the mid-rib distinct below and sunken above.
<i>Flowers</i> in many-flowered clusters. <i>Calyx</i> 5-lobed almost to the base,
pubescent. <i>Corolla-tube</i> 2 cm. long, narrowly cylindric, pubescent
outside, hairy within at the throat; lobes 4 mm. long, 3 mm. broad,
elliptic, rounded at the apex. Anthers ovate in outline, with a few
hairs at the apex. Style 1·4 mm. long, cylindric; stigma subglobose,
with a few hairs at the apex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>A. spectabilis</i> is very easily distinguished from <i>A. venenata</i> by its
longer petioles, usually larger size, and less elliptic shape and
different venation of its leaves, the veins (at least in the dried
state) being far less prominent and less ascending than they are in <i>A.
venenata</i>, and the flowers are much larger, the corolla-tube of <i>A.
spectabilis</i> being 14-20 mm. long, whilst those of <i>A. venenata</i> are
only 8-12 mm. long. Dried specimens show no intermediates.&mdash;<span class="smcap">N. E.

<p>This species was imported into England from Kaffraria by Messrs.
Backhouse, and presented by them to the Horticultural Society of London
in 1846. Two years later, in the <i>Journal</i> of the Society, Dr. Lindley
described the plant, and the description was accompanied by a woodcut.
In 1860 a plant flowered in the greenhouse at Kew, and was figured and
described in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>, t. 5218, by Hooker. The specimens
from which the present illustration was made were gathered by Miss K. A.
Lansdell at Krantzkloof, Natal. The plant is known as the “Kei Lily.”</p>

<p>Lovers of our South African succulents will welcome this plate of a new
Transvaal <i>Stapelia</i>, discovered by Mr. G. F. Gettleffi at Louis
Trichardt in the Zoutpansberg District. It is closely allied to
<i>Stapelia hirsuta</i>, which occurs in the Western Province of the Cape,
but the flowers are larger, the cilia longer, and the rudimentary leaves
are more developed. The illustration given here was made from specimens
growing on the rockeries of the Division of Botany, Pretoria, but there
is no record of the locality from which the original plants came. In
1916 a coloured illustration of the species appeared in the <i>Botanical
Magazine</i> (t. 8681), made from a specimen which flowered in the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Kew, in June 1915, which was sent to England by Mr. N.
S. Pillans. Mr. Pillans’ specimens came from Palapye Road, near
Mafeking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A succulent herb 10-20 cm. high. <i>Stems</i> decumbent,

<p>This species of <i>Streptocarpus</i>, which belongs to a section of the genus
characterised by the development of one leaf only, was first brought to
the notice of horticulturists in 1884 by Mr. E. G. Dunn, who sent seeds
to Kew from Spitzkop in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>The seeds germinated freely, and in May and June of 1886 the plants were
a feature of the Succulent House at Kew. The genus <i>Streptocarpus</i> is
well represented in South Africa, and at least 24 distinct species are
known.</p>

<p>Our illustration was made from plants grown by Mr. C. E. Gray, Pretoria,
from specimens collected by Dr. Pole Evans on Mr. Geo. Heys’ farm,
Weltevreden, Machadodorp, where it grows on rocks at the side of a
stream.</p>

<p>A common water plant in many of our South African rivers and vleis, and
it is not surprising that such a handsome species soon found its way to
cultivators in Europe. Masson, about the year 1792, appears to have
first introduced it into England by forwarding specimens from the Cape
to the Royal Gardens at Kew. It was not long before coloured plates
appeared in the botanical publications of the day, and the first of
these was published in 1801 in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> and about the
same time in Andrews’ <i>Botanist’s Repository</i>. A second figure again
appeared in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> about 18 years later. The species,
commonly known as the “Blue Water Lily” (Zulu “i-Ziba”), is easy of
cultivation, and is found in most garden ponds in South Africa. Our
illustration was made from specimens growing in the aquarium of the
Natal Herbarium, Durban.</p>

<p>This species was first collected by Drège between the Bashee River and
Morley, in Tembuland, about the year 1831, but the species has been
found by several collectors since then. Its altitudinal range of
distribution is wide, as it has been recorded by the late Dr. Wood from
the sub-tropical climate of Durban and from Oliver’s Hoek Pass on the
Drakensbergen, which is occasionally covered with snow in the winter
months. The plant is a very ornamental twiner, easily cultivated, and
well worth the attention of horticulturists. The accompanying
illustration was made from specimens growing in the garden of the Natal
Herbarium at Durban.</p>

<p>This is one of the largest and most handsome species in the genus and is
frequently cultivated in South African gardens. Thunberg appears to have
been the first collector of this plant; he gathered his specimens near
the Zeekoe River in Humansdorp Division about 1772, but the species was
known in England before then, as there is a record of Miller having it
in cultivation in 1758. The first figure of the species appeared in the
<i>Botanical Magazine</i> in 1804 and it has been figured several times
since. The present illustration was made from specimens growing in the
garden of the Natal Herbarium, Durban.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Pappe first brought this species to the notice of Kew as an
undescribed South African plant, and not long afterwards (1862), Dr.
Sanderson sent bulbs from Natal to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which
flowered the following year. An excellent figure of the plant appeared
in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> of the same year. The species appears to be
fairly common in Natal, but the only Cape Province record we have is
supplied by a specimen collected by Mr. W. Tyson at Kokstad, East
Griqualand, 1883. The present illustration was made from specimens
collected by Miss K. A. Lansdell at “Stella Bush” near Durban. It is
popularly known as the “Blood Flower,” “Snake Lily,” and “April Fool.”
It is reputed to be poisonous, but is used medicinally by the natives of
Natal who know it as “Indumbe-ka-Hloile.”</p>

<p>The species of <i>Cyrtanthus</i>, which with one exception are confined to
South Africa, have always received notice from gardeners. Our plant was
described in 1869 from specimens sent to Europe by Mr. McKen, and a
coloured drawing appeared soon after (1873) in one of the illustrated
botanical publications. As far as our records go, this species is
confined to Natal, where it is known as the “Ifafa Lily.” The specimens
from which our illustration was made were gathered by Miss K. A.
Lansdell on the banks of the Ifafa River near Port Shepstone, the
original locality in which Mr. McKen first discovered the species. The
flowers are strongly scented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;<i>Bulb</i> 3-4 cm. in diameter, ovoid; tunics brown,

<p>This interesting plant, the only species known in the genus, was first
found by Dr. Carl Thunberg at Noordhoek and False Bay on the Cape
Peninsula and described by him in 1782. It appears to be confined to
damp habitats in the Cape Province, and has been found by the late Dr.
Bolus at Houw Hoek in Caledon Division. It has also been recorded from
the Tradouw Mountains in Swellendam Division, and this year (1920) Mr.
T. P. Stokoe has discovered the plant on the Klein River Mountains near
Caledon. It is a rare species and would only interest enthusiastic
cultivators on account of its rarity.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Stokoe for the living specimens from which this
plate was prepared. The plant is known locally as “Waaiertje.”</p>

<p>This beautiful <i>Cyrtanthus</i> was described by Aiton in 1789, probably
from plants collected in South Africa by Masson, who sent specimens of
this species to England in 1774. The fact that it has been so frequently
figured is an indication that it has appealed largely to
horticulturists. Jacquin first produced a coloured plate in 1797 and the
last figure we know of in botanical literature is that quoted above.</p>

<p>The specimens from which the present plate was prepared flowered in the
Gardens of the Division of Botany, Pretoria, from bulbs gathered on the
mountains at Bethelsdorp near Port Elizabeth by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans.</p>

shallow soil overlaying quartzite, with a southern aspect. In the
locality the plant is extremely rare.</p>

<p>As far as we are aware this is the first record of the species since it
was collected by Niven.</p>

<p>The common species of <i>Mimetes</i> (<i>M. lyrigera</i>, Knight) is known as the
“Rooi Stompie,” and as the above species is confined to damp habitats we
propose the name “Water Stompie” for it.</p>

<p>This species is another <i>rara avis</i> of the Cape Flora. It was figured
for the first time in 1848 (<i>Botanical Magazine</i> t. 4357) from a
painting sent by Dr. Pappe to Kew. Carl Zeyher discovered the species on
the Hottentots Holland Mountains, and for very many years afterwards it
remained unknown to botanists in the fresh state. Mr. E. J. Steer, of
Cape Town, some years ago purchased specimens from a coloured
flower-seller and photographed it, and this year (1920) it was met with
more than once exposed for sale among the wild flowers in Adderley
Street, Cape Town. Every effort of botanical collectors to discover the
locality in which the species grows has up to now proved unsuccessful,
and no information can be obtained from the coloured flower-pickers. The
plant has no local name as far as we have been able to ascertain, and we
propose the name “Zeyher’s Orothamnus” for this species.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Having been asked by Dr. Pole Evans to see the
proofs of the first sheets of this new work through the press, he
empowered me to make any change of nomenclature that might be necessary.
For owing to the want of types and some of the rarer books at Pretoria,
it is not always possible to make correct identifications there. From
this cause the plants represented upon Plates 3 and 4 were
misidentified, and the names “<i>Arctotis decurrens</i>” and “<i>Cyrtanthus
angustifolius</i>” already printed upon the plates before they came into my
hands for verification and found to represent new species. I have
therefore substituted new names for these two plants, and have added
Latin descriptions compiled from the drawings and Dr. Phillips’ English
descriptions, which have not been altered.
</p><p>
It may not be out of place to state that the true <i>Arctotis decurrens</i>,
Jacq. (which this species was supposed to be), differs by the basal
leaves having usually only one small lobe or (grown under the condition
of much moisture in a rich soil) two lobes on each side, and an
elongated ovate oblong terminal lobe twice or more than twice as long as
broad; the branching stem and peduncles have small entire leaves
scattered along them; the ray florets are without a yellow spot at the
base, and the pappus-scales are truncate (not pointed) at the tips.&mdash;<span class="smcap">N.
E. Brown.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> As stated under Plate 3, this plant had been supposed to be
a form of <i>C. angustifolius</i>, and that name has unfortunately been
printed upon the plate. It proves to be an entirely new species, well
characterised by the very slender curved basal part of the flower-tube,
and the long, tapering and very acute tips of the leaves, which are
narrowed at the base into terete petioles, and also, to judge from the
figure, are not produced at the same time as the flowers. In the true
<i>C. angustifolius</i>, Aiton, the flowers and leaves are produced at the
same time, the latter are flat to the base and very shortly pointed at
the tips; the tube of the flower gradually narrows from apex to base
without being contracted into a very slender basal part, and is less
curved there.
</p><p>
There is a large-flowered variety of <i>C. angustifolius</i> known as var.
<i>grandiflorus</i>, Baker, which does not seem to be clearly understood in
South Africa. A good figure of it, but reduced in size, appears in the
<i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i>, 1905, vol. 37, p. 261, f. 110, No. 2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">N. E.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Note.</span> Although mistaken in South Africa for an allied
species, this pretty bulb differs from all the other small-flowered
species in the genus by its broad linear-lanceolate leaves, and the
broadly elliptic or suborbicular perianth-lobes, which have suggested
the specific name to me. In all the other species the perianth-lobes are
oblong or elliptic-oblong. My description is compiled partly from the
English description of Dr. Phillips and partly from a dried
specimen.&mdash;<span class="smcap">N. E. Brown.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;As Dr. Phillips has compared this plant with <i>S.
Burmanni Sweet</i>, I would like to point out that it is very doubtful if
the <i>S. Burmanni</i> of the <i>Flora Capensis</i> and the specimens in Herbaria
so named, really represent the plant figured by Burmann, upon which that
species was founded. Burmann (<i>Rar. Afr. Pl.</i> p. 7, t. 31) represents a
plant with stems about half as thick as those of <i>S. rigidum</i>,
constricted into short globose joints, with crenate (not entire) leaves
and small flowers, of which he does not state the colours. I am doubtful
if this plant is at present correctly represented in Herbaria.
</p><p>
It may also be well to point out that although the authority for the
genus <i>Sarcocaulon</i> and the species <i>S. Burmanni</i> and <i>S. Heritieri</i> are
attributed to De Candolle in the <i>Flora Capensis</i> they should be
credited to Sweet, since De Candolle described them both as species of
<i>Monsonia</i> under the section <i>Sarcocaulon</i>, which Sweet rightly
recognised as a distinct genus.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
